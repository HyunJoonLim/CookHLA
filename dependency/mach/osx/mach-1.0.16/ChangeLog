1.0.9
-----

  Added beta version of "thunder" program, for modeling shot-gun resequencing data.

1.0.7
-----

  Changed .mlinfo file to include allele frequency in addition to minor allele frequency.

  Tweaked non-parametric association statistics to also include case only and control only
  analysis.

1.0.5
-----

  --mle option optionally generates an output with posterior genotype probabilities. 
        output includes the probability of being homozygote for the first allele and
        the probability of being heterozygous. The first allele is defined in .mlinfo
        output file.

  --mldetails option controls whether .mlqc and .mlprobs (see above) output files are
        generated. By default, these files are not generated to save disk space. To
        request them, use --mldetails together with --mle.

1.0.4
-----

  Improved error handling for badly formatted input files.

1.0.3
-----

 Improved handling of crashes.

1.0.2
-----

  Multiple small bug fixes and improvements in speed.

  Added .info files which provide summaries of data quality for imputed genotypes, by marker.

  Add --mle option for rapid imputation against a reference panel.

1.0.1
-----

  First source code release of Mach 1.0
